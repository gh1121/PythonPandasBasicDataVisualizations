    "# Formatting Plots in Pandas\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to use built-in functions in pandas to customize the appearance of our plots. We'll adjust the figure size, colors, and markers. To illustrate the native capabilities of pandas, we won't import any extra libraries like Matplotlib. However, it's important to note that Matplotlib must still be installed, as pandas's plotting capabilities are built upon it, even though we don't need to explicitly import it in our code.\n",
    "For more advanced customization, importing Matplotlib or Seaborn as a separate library might be required. Remember that pandas plotting is best for quick exploratory plots, while libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn are preferred when more customization is required.\n",
